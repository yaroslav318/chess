# Contributing

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in contributing to the project.

We welcome contributions of any kind; however, for **feature changes or additions**, please open an issue first for discussion.

## Getting Started

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/nizefoo/chessu/fork) to your GitHub account. You can then clone the repository to your local machine and create a new branch for your changes.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/chessu.git
   cd chessu
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
2. Follow the [setup guide](./README.md#getting-started) from the README to install the necessary dependencies and run the development servers.
3. You may now make your changes and commit them to your branch.

When adding new dependencies or running other commands from the root directory, you can specify the workspace with the `-w` flag. For example, `npm run build -w client` or `npm install express -w server`.

### Formatting and linting

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style and formatting. Please make sure to run `npm run lint-fix` and `npm run format` before committing your changes.

### Environment variables

You may create a `.env` file in each package directory to set their environment variables.
